# AI-Aimbot
 This Python script demonstrates a simple aimbot for Minecraft, detecting and attacking "zombie" and "wither skeleton" entities using the YOLOv5 object detection model. It utilizes MSS for screen capturing, OpenCV for image display, PyTorch for loading YOLOv5, and PyAutoGUI for mouse control.
